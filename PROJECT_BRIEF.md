# Dental Backend Project Brief

## Project Overview
A headless backend system for processing and analyzing 3D dental scan data, supporting multiple 3D file formats with HIPAA/GDPR compliance for healthcare data handling.

## Scope & Constraints

### Supported File Formats
- **STL** (Stereolithography) - Binary and ASCII variants
- **PLY** (Polygon File Format) - Binary and ASCII variants
- **OBJ** (Wavefront Object) - With associated MTL materials
- **glTF/GLB** (Graphics Library Transmission Format) - 2.0 specification

### Technical Constraints
- **Headless Architecture**: No GUI components, API-first design
- **Python â‰¥3.10**: Minimum runtime requirement for modern type hints and features
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Healthcare data protection standards
- **GDPR Compliance**: European data privacy regulations
- **3D Processing**: Mesh analysis, validation, and optimization capabilities

### Core Functionality
1. **File Processing**: Import, validate, and convert between supported formats
2. **Mesh Analysis**: Geometric analysis, quality assessment, and defect detection
3. **Data Management**: Secure storage, retrieval, and versioning of scan data
4. **API Services**: RESTful endpoints for client applications
5. **Background Processing**: Asynchronous job processing for heavy computations
6. **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and audit logging

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for metadata operations
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for processing workloads
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful error handling
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- **Compliance**: Audit trails and data retention policies

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Python 3.10+
- **Framework**: FastAPI for API services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data
- **Message Queue**: Redis/Celery for background processing
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana for observability

### Success Criteria
- Successfully process all supported 3D file formats
- Maintain HIPAA/GDPR compliance throughout data lifecycle
- Achieve sub-100ms API response times for metadata operations
- Support concurrent processing of multiple scan files
- Provide comprehensive audit logging and monitoring
